# COBOL-AIRLINES
COBOL + DB2 + CICS PROJECT - I DESIGNED A AIRLINE INTERNAL SYSTEM - NAMED COBOL AIRLINES
This is a personal project which the goal is present and also develop my skills in COBOL, CICS and DB2.
The project consists in the development of an internal system of an airline company.
This project will be developed entirely in English, also with the objectif of demonstrating my skills in this language.
The complete project will have 6 types of access to the system. The CEO, Air Staff, Salespeople, IT Support, HR and the Schedule Department.
These accesses to the system will take place online, not batch, through CICS. Most of the information will be stored in the DB2 database.
At the moment, the database has already been developed, as well as a password encryption system. The first access mode that I'm developing is the sales department access. Therefore, the flight search and ticket search screens have already been developed, as well as its functionality. Now the next step is develop the maps for the search and registration of passengers and for the ticket's sale. So the first access mode will be complete. 
When this mode will be complete some video of the system operation will be released.

All comments, opinions or help are welcome.
